Hey! This update has something for my fellow Create and Farmer's Delight enjoyers out there. Read on!

## 🔧 Changes
- Spore blossoms can now be crafted into pink dye in a crafting table.
  - They can also be cut on a Farmer's Delight chopping board and milled in a Create millstone. These options will yield more dye per item.

## 🐛 Fixes
- Now supports 1.21.4.
