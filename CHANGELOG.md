Hey! The minor versions have finally stabilized, allowing me to bring you a new update along with the wonderful Chase The Skies drop! This one includes an interesting feature I have had on the backburner since the beginning and have only now got around to writing!

# ü™¶ Ending the "Florum Chore-um"
I have finally stood up for the part of myself that had been weighed under by the workload of handling multiple game versions at the same time.

For those in the modding scene you'll know it's a pain in the ass to keep up with. For those *not* in the know: it's incredibly demotivating and shifts my focus away from the quality of the content I make. For this reason, I have decided **I will no longer be supporting versions before the most recent release**.

I am aware that this will alienate a portion of my consumers: it's simply the only way forward for me to continue enjoying what I do. I am sorry if you're someone who will be affected by this decision. I hope you can continue to enjoy my work!!

# ‚ûï Additions
**Panda snot!** Well, that already existed. A little-known fact about panda cubs is that they have an increeeedibly low chance of sneezing (a little bit higher if they have the "weak" personality) and an average of 1 in every 500 sneezes will drop a slime ball.

As it stands, this is the only way to obtain slime in the Peaceful difficulty which makes it a shame that the chance of it happening is so fundamentally, infeasibly small. **Florum Sporum 1.8.0** aims to fix that!

The chance of panda cubs sneezing has not been changed: 1 in 6000 ticks for normal panda cubs and 1 in 500 ticks for weak ones. However, every sneeze will now drop a slime ball. Now, the way this relates back to spore blossoms is that standing in a spot underneath a "spore shower"--the particles that fall from fully-grown flowers that are hanging from the ceiling--will now increase this probability even further, to 1 in 100 ticks.

Note that this overrides the bonus gotten by the panda cub being "weak".

I'm probably going to be workshopping this feature for a while. Let me know your thoughts over on the "Florum Forum" (my [Discord server][discord]) or the GitHub [issues] page!

# üîß Changes
- Switched to using the Fabric API tooltip callback instead of original mixins.
- Tweaked the textures to better represent furled-up petals instead of merely smaller variants of the spore blossom.
- Updated the mod icon.

# üêõ Fixes
- The textures of some parts of the spore blossoms' models are no longer inappropriately mirrored.
- Fully-grown spore blossoms from the creative menu now correctly stack with ones that have been placed down and broken.
- Updated `ru_RU` localization. Thanks, [mpustovoi]!
