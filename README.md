Florum Sporum is a client and server-side [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) mod that attempts to breathe more life into spore blossoms, without undoing any of Mojang's work!

### Getting Started
Due to the use of custom sound registration and resources, you will need to download [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric) in order to use it. Once you have, simply drag both the Fabric API and <strong>Florum Sporum</strong> into your mods folder.
